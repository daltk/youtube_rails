== WhooTube 0.9.2

WhooTube is a proof-of-concept to demonstrate Flash video streaming using Ruby technology.
It has been developed during a live coding demonstration at the RubyEnRails 2007 conference
by Roderick van Domburg and Sjoerd Andringa, who are employed at Nedforce.

== Technologies

WhooTube uses the following technologies to make it tick. The version numbers in brackets
indicate the versions this release has been tested with:

 * Ruby (1.8.6)
 * Ruby on Rails (1.2.3)
 * BackgrounDRb (0.2.1)
 * ffmpeg (r9102)
 * FLVTool2 (1.0.6)
 * acts_as_taggable_on_steroids (2007-04-23)

== Deployment notes

 * Edit lib/workers/video_worker.rb to specify the location to ffmpeg and FLVTool2.

 * Run script/backgroundrb {run|start} to fire up the BackgrounDRb server.

 * BackgrounDRb currently does not offer Windows support, and so WhooTube doesn't either.

 * FLVTool2 is a RubyGem. It has been packaged into the vendor/plugins directory, but you
   may need to manually install it using RubyGems depending on your platform.
 
== Jumping board

The code contained herein is for demonstration purposes only and not deemed fit for any
purpose. While it's a great jumping board to start developing video-enabled Rails apps,
there's pieces in here that are not DRY, fail-safe, or otherwise complete.

If you're looking to put this code to commercial use, then we warmly invite you to get in
touch with Nedforce. We've got a proven solution that not only saves you precious development
time, but also gives you:

 * Vastly improved exception handling
 * Automated, schedulable maintenance utilities for cleanup and error correction
 * A deployment scenario that's tweaked for scalability
 * Optional authorization that's compatible with your current authentication
 * Optional permalinking and clean URLs for search engine optimization
